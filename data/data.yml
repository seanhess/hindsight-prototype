comment:  I made put put boats with the kids! You make a little boiler out of a tin can and ticky tack, then put a candle underneath to heat it up. It moves around a bathtub and makes a cute sound. The boys loved it.

comment:  Took peter skiing. It was warm. We mostly played in the snow but we went up and down that hill a couple of times. He was pretty brave for parts of it, and managed to turn. I would push him up the hill so he didn't have to walk, because the tow rope was broken. At the end we begged them to let us ride up the bunny lift, and they did, but Peter was too scared so I showed him how to slide down on his bottom, and we made it down.

comment:  Catherine was saying she wanted to be the kind of person who hiked more, so we went hiking to a little reservoir up by the mountains. The kids did great mostly. It was muddy and dried out all at once. We talked about exploring other states and moving again, because Catherine was feeling ansy. We decided to try road tripping to explore places and maybe moving out of the state.

comment:  Catherine's parents came up to see some christmas lights on a street in sugarhouse. It was nice, but when we were leaving I locked Elora in the car. We called the police and they sent a firetruck and an abulance. It was overkill, but they got the door open and were nice about it.

comment:  Ty and Lee came to town and we went out together. We went to Cafe Rio for dinner, and Tyler asked us about leaving the church, but he mostly wanted to know if we were happy. We went to the lights at the zoo, but we got there 30 minutes late, so we went to the bookstore and showed each other books we loved. On the way, Catherine navigated for me and we totally got lost because I was being too literal.

comment:  Played Little Wizards. The boys both played cats who could shapeshift into other animals. They got sucked into a mirror world full of goblins and monsters. I'm planning on playing with them regularly. We'll see if I do it :)

comment:  My mom watched all the kids so we had lots of date time. We visited Karen and Aaron at their apartment, went to sushi, then went to a game night with some friends Catherine had met at her party. They were a rowdy bunch. After the only mormon couple left, we got to talk about our leaving-the-church stories. We stayed way too long, until 2am! I was super tired.

comment:  Went skiing by myself on Sunday. It had just snowed, and hadn't stopped. It was super cold and foggy, but I got a tip from a Mountain Host and went to Gad 2, which had some great tree runs. I stayed until it closed, and only got charlie horses on the last run. I talked to more strangers and had a lot more fun than last time.

comment:  Played the second and last cthulhu session of In a Different Light at Brian's house. They got really suspicious of the lights and smashed them all, mostly stopping the Old One, but not before almost going insane and blowing themselves up in a cave. Played with Jared, Brian, Isaac, and Jason. Scott bailed because he was sick.
